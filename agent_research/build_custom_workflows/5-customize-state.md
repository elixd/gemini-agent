In this tutorial, you will add additional fields to the state to define complex behavior without relying on the message list. The chatbot will use its search tool to find specific information and forward them to a human for review.

## 1. Add keys to the state

Update the chatbot to research the birthday of an entity by adding `name` and `birthday` keys to the state:

API Reference: [add_messages](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.message.add_messages)

```
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    name: str
    birthday: str
```

Adding this information to the state makes it easily accessible by other graph nodes (like a downstream node that stores or processes the information), as well as the graph's persistence layer.

Now, populate the state keys inside of the `human_assistance` tool. This allows a human to review the information before it is stored in the state. Use [`Command`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#using-inside-tools) to issue a state update from inside the tool.

```
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool

from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

@tool
# Note that because we are generating a ToolMessage for a state update, we
# generally require the ID of the corresponding tool call. We can use
# LangChain's InjectedToolCallId to signal that this argument should not
# be revealed to the model in the tool's schema.
def human_assistance(
    name: str, birthday: str, tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId]
) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "name": name,
            "birthday": birthday,
        },
    )
    # If the information is correct, update the state as-is.
    if human_response.get("correct", "").lower().startswith("y"):
        verified_name = name
        verified_birthday = birthday
        response = "Correct"
    # Otherwise, receive information from the human reviewer.
    else:
        verified_name = human_response.get("name", name)
        verified_birthday = human_response.get("birthday", birthday)
        response = f"Made a correction: {human_response}"

    # This time we explicitly update the state with a ToolMessage inside
    # the tool.
    state_update = {
        "name": verified_name,
        "birthday": verified_birthday,
        "messages": [ToolMessage(response, tool_call_id=tool_call_id)],
    }
    # We return a Command object in the tool to update our state.
    return Command(update=state_update)
```

The rest of the graph stays the same.

## 3. Prompt the chatbot

Prompt the chatbot to look up the "birthday" of the LangGraph library and direct the chatbot to reach out to the `human_assistance` tool once it has the required information. By setting `name` and `birthday` in the arguments for the tool, you force the chatbot to generate proposals for these fields.

```
user_input = (
    "Can you look up when LangGraph was released? "
    "When you have the answer, use the human_assistance tool for review."
)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```

## 4. Add human assistance

The chatbot failed to identify the correct date, so supply it with information:

```
human_command = (
    Command(
    resume={
        "name": "LangGraph",
        "birthday": "Jan 17, 2024",
    },
)
)

events = graph.stream(human_command, config, stream_mode="values")
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```

================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: human_assistance

We, the experts are here to help! We'd recommend you check out LangGraph to build your agent. It's much more reliable and extensible than simple autonomous agents.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thank you for your patience. I've received some expert advice regarding your request for guidance on building an AI agent. Here's what the experts have suggested:

The experts recommend that you look into LangGraph for building your AI agent. They mention that LangGraph is a more reliable and extensible option compared to simple autonomous agents.

LangGraph is likely a framework or library designed specifically for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities. Here are a few points to consider based on this recommendation:

1. Reliability: The experts emphasize that LangGraph is more reliable than simpler autonomous agent approaches. This could mean it has better stability, error handling, or consistent performance.

2. Extensibility: LangGraph is described as more extensible, which suggests that it probably offers a flexible architecture that allows you to easily add new features or modify existing ones as your agent's requirements evolve.

3. Advanced capabilities: Given that it's recommended over "simple autonomous agents," LangGraph likely provides more sophisticated tools and techniques for building complex AI agents.
...
2. Look for tutorials or guides specifically focused on building AI agents with LangGraph.
3. Check if there are any community forums or discussion groups where you can ask questions and get support from other developers using LangGraph.

If you'd like more specific information about LangGraph or have any questions about this recommendation, please feel free to ask, and I can request further assistance from the experts.

The input has been received and processed as a tool message. Review this call's [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/9f0f87e3-56a7-4dde-9c76-b71675624e91/r) to see the exact work that was done in the above call. Notice that the state is loaded in the first step so that our chatbot can continue where it left off.

**Congratulations!** You've used an `interrupt` to add human-in-the-loop execution to your chatbot, allowing for human oversight and intervention when needed. This opens up the potential UIs you can create with your AI systems. Since you have already added a **checkpointer**, as long as the underlying persistence layer is running, the graph can be paused **indefinitely** and resumed at any time as if nothing had happened.

Check out the code snippet below to review the graph from this tutorial:

```
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"
```

```
import os
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4.1")
```

## Next steps

There's one more concept to review before finishing the LangGraph basics tutorials: connecting `checkpointing` and `state updates` to [time travel](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/6-time-travel/).

LangGraph is built for developers who want to build powerful, adaptable AI agents. Developers choose LangGraph for:

-   **Reliability and controllability.** Steer agent actions with moderation checks and human-in-the-loop approvals. LangGraph persists context for long-running workflows, keeping your agents on course.
-   **Low-level and extensible.** Build custom agents with fully descriptive, low-level primitives free from rigid abstractions that limit customization. Design scalable multi-agent systems, with each agent serving a specific role tailored to your use case.
-   **First-class streaming support.** With token-by-token streaming and streaming of intermediate steps, LangGraph gives users clear visibility into agent reasoning and actions as they unfold in real time.

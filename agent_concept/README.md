# Project Brief: Local Coding & Personal Assistant Agent

## 1. Your Mission

Your primary mission is to build a new AI agent based on the concepts and principles outlined in this folder. The agent will be a local, CLI-based assistant with coding and personal assistance capabilities, built using LangGraph. You will build this agent iteratively, following the provided roadmap.

## 2. Your First Task

Your immediate task is to begin **Phase 1** of the development plan.

**Reference:** See `development_roadmap.md` for the detailed, step-by-step plan.

## 3. Conceptual Document Index

This folder contains the complete conceptual framework for the project. Use these documents as your guide and source of truth.

-   **`development_roadmap.md`**: **(START HERE)** The step-by-step plan for what to build and in what order.
-   **`programming_approach.md`**: The rules for *how* to write the code (functional, testable, observable).
-   **`project_structure.md`**: The target directory and file layout for the project.
-   **`architecture.md`**: The high-level overview of the LangGraph state machine.
-   **`tools.md`**: A reference for the specific tools and capabilities the final agent should possess.
-   **`memory.md`**: The theory behind the agent's short-term and long-term memory systems.
-   **`full_prompt.md`**: A description of how the full prompt is assembled from different components.
-   **`system_prompt_example.md`**: A single, comprehensive example of the agent's full system prompt.
-   **The System Prompt**: The core instructions for the agent, broken down by theme in the `prompt_components` directory.
-   **`document_interaction.md`**: A guide for how the agent should reason about reading and using file content.
-   **`core_principles.md`**: The high-level, guiding principles of the agent's behavior.

Your development process should adhere strictly to the principles outlined in these documents. Begin.

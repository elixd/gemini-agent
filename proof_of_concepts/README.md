# Proof of Concepts

This directory contains a collection of small, focused scripts that were created to solve specific technical challenges and validate our approaches.

Each script is a "proof of concept" (PoC) that demonstrates a working solution to a problem we faced during development. They are preserved here as a living record of our technical decisions and as a reference to prevent us from having to solve the same problems in the future.

Before attempting to solve a complex new problem, check this directory to see if a related PoC already exists.
